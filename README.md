    Steps:
    ------
    1. Used MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture for developing the console application.
    2. Added the required Models, Views and Controller along with Interface implementation to achieve abstraction.
    3. Added user-defined exceptions to catch anf handle the exceptions.
    4. Used encapsulation to hide data and used getter and setter for getting and setting the data for the models.
    5. Used "ArrayList" to store and manipulate data according to the user preferrences.
    6. Used "CSV" Files for handling data.
    7. Stored the file path, Scanner class other sensitive information in a separate Utility folder.
    8. Used Singleton pattern to avoid creating objects.
    9. Used "Date" class for handling date for orders.
    10. Handled exceptions for invalid choices.
 
    Challenges:
